# ESP8266-AirSensor
Using a ESP8266 to collect and analyze data about the air (temperature, humidity, etc.)

This project is about building an IoT device that collects information about the air.
The sensor data should then be sent to Thingspeak or an MQTT broker.
Data on temperature, humidity and air quality in your room can be viewed online.
In addition, I would like to integrate a small web server that provides the sensor data via a REST API.
In the future I might want to add a display and set up a notification system that will send you a notification when there is bad air in your room.

## DHT11-Thingspeak
This sketch sends temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor to Thingspeak.

### Hardware Requirements
* NodeMCU ESP8266 Board
* 4.7k Ohm Resistor

## DHT11-MQ135-Thingspeak
This sketch sends data from DHT11 and MQ135 to Thingspeak.

### Hardware Requirements

### Setup
1. At first, the sensor has to be calibrated. For this, connect the sensor to the circuit and leave it powered on for 24 hours to burn in.
2. Then put it into outside air for one hour at preferably at 20Â°C and 35% relative humidity. After that the calibration value should have settled.
Now we have to read out the calibration value `rzero = gasSensor.getRZero();`
3. After that we replace the predefined RZero constant with our determined value in the file `MQ135.h`` from the MQ135 sensor library: `#define RZERO 890`
(Note: Every sensor has a own specific RZero!)
